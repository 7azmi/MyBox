*Asset Preset Postprocess Tool:
	Tool to automatically assign Presets to Assets conditionally on Import stage with AssetPostprocessor
	"path contains/of type/with prefix/with postfix"
	
*MustBeAssigned may work with ScriptableObjects in project? 
	Allow to disable this feature? Measure performance
	
*Multiscene asset
	To save/load opened loaded/active scenes in editor
	
*IPrepare interface
	To add custom logic to Behaviours
	Execute those on Playmode and game build
	To cache/calculate heavy stuff
	
*MyGizmosHandler
	MyDebug.DrawText is working only in OnDrawGizmos :( 
	I want to access OnDrawGizmos in non-MonoBehaviour scripts
	MB with static access, with lazy initialization and HideAndDontSave?
		EveryFrame subscription is heavy...
		Push struct with IDraw and logic to draw with gizmos, remove pusded structs from MyGizmosHandler.OnDrawGizmos? Measure performance
		Some way to draw every-frame Gizmos with system, that run only once per x seconds?
		
		
*AnimationCreator is pretty cool with simple Idle-Play or looping Idle animators. 
	Is it possible to play animation without animator? 
		https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/SimpleAnimation
	
*EmbeddedAnimationCreator to EmbeddedAssetCreator? 
	It's cool to have, to pack related assets into one parent asset
	Yeah, I know how parent assets, but how to unparent?
	
*MyBundleUtility is a mess. Might be useful
	Tools to build bundles out of scenes (with multiscene solutions)
		And handle bundles loading/unloading on scene load/unload?
		
*TemplatesCreator
	Add a way to add templates as separate assets
	There is no way to have MenuItems with runtime naming :(?
		MenuItems is separate feature/wrapper for TemplateCreator?
